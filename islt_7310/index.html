<h2>Hello my name is Harrison, and welcome to my website!</h2>
<p>This website is to act like a brief understanding of a subject and help someone that may need the basis for further information about a certain subject. In this case, I want to supply one place (my website) of all the facts on an idea and the understanding of a new/newer experienced personâ€™s deep dive into the sport of soccer. My goal and objective of my website is simple. To help those that are struggling and give them a beacon of hope in what they may be researching, and act as an educational outlet for this information.</p>
