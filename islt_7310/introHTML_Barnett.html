    My name is Nina Barnett. I am from Chicago, IL, and I am a senior at the University of Missouri.  Currently I am an Interdisciplinary degree major, and I chose to enroll in this course to complete my graphic design component of my degree. I have very little training with coding that I received during a STEM camp about four years ago at UIC. I’ve also built 2 websites in the past; however, they were through the website builder, GoDaddy. With this course I expect to expand my knowledge and learn how to build a website custom to me or any business, without the restrictions of a website builder or template. I hope to continue to expand my knowledge and build websites for companies and businesses. This can be an extra service to add to my presumed graphic design business, “Imani Design”. My favorite hobby would be to go out to eat with friends, or to just relax. I’ve recently enjoyed going to the Mizzou REC center and taking various types of classes and going to the pool. I have a passion for hair, so doing hair is also what I do in my free time.
