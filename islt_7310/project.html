    <p id="didot-para">Here, the assignment was to create an informational typography poster about a person who created a famous typeface. 
        We were required to include the entire alphabet and punctuation in our chosen typeface. 
        I chose the “Didot” typeface created by Firmin Didot, because I like the simple, yet expensive look it has to it. 
        The Didot typeface is used for many companies, including some upscale magazines, which is the theme approach I took with the design on the right. 
        I had to play around with this design to make the title fit exactly how I wanted. 
        I initially put a picture of Firmin Didot in the middle of the page, but it wasn’t interesting enough. 
        So, I kept the magazine aesthetic in mind and thought of creative ways to incorporate the letters without just putting them on the page. 
        his is where the large letters in the background come in. At first, they were just that opaque yellow color, but this was too plain. 
        I paired it with blue because these colors complement each other well. I lowered the opacity to them to make them less distracting. 
        On the left, I decided to make it more informational rather than focus on a specific aesthetic. 
        I created this one first during my creative thinking hours in the middle of the night. 
        I included an opaque grey-blue illustration of Firmin Didot in the background, and incorporated pops of orange throughout. 
        I had a hard time choosing between the two designs, but eventually went with the one on the left. For this, I used Adobe Illustrator.</p>

  <p id="fruit-para">This is my example of a recipe book assignment we had. It didn’t necessarily have to be a recipe, but just steps on how to do something. 
      The goal was to present the same steps in different required ways. For example, using different weight, space, color, punctuation, etc... 
      These are only some of the pages out of my recipe book. I chose to do steps on how to make a fruit salad. 
      Here you can see some fruit clip-art illustrations that I made myself and a couple of the component designs I created. 
      The clip art was something I had to try doing twice, in two different ways. Initially, I was just winging it in Adobe Illustrator. 
      However, after watching a YouTube video, I learned a much better way to make my fruit. They looked cleaner, brighter, and much better overall. 
      I’ve also provided examples of some of my divider page designs, and the title page of my recipe book as well. 
      It was a bit difficult coming up with several way to compose the information without the designs becoming repetitive. 
      But being allowed to use color and visual punctuation towards the end of the book made it easier for me to be more creative with my designs. 
      The books itself was made using Adobe InDesign.</p>

<p id="poster-para">For this project we were given information for a concert in a pdf. 
    With this, we had to create three different poster designs including all the information. 
    This was harder than it seems considering we were given paragraphs of information, and still had to fit everything onto the poster, without it looking cramped of like too much to read. 
    The first poster had to be text only. No color, and no visual punctuation. We also couldn’t use very large fonts like you see in the other two poster designs. 
    It was difficult including so much information without it looking too busy or boring. This one took me a couple tries. 
    The second poster we were allowed to use both text and visual punctuation, such as the black rectangles I used in the middle design. 
    The third poster we were allowed to use visual punctuation and color. I rushed to do this one because they were all due in one class period. 
    The purpose of this assignment was also to work under pressure</p>

    <p id="caterpillar-para">This was our specimen poster project in Graphic Design 1. For this, we were to choose a picture of an insect and create a detailed drawing. 
        I first chose a beetle, but most pictures of beetles already lacked detail. 
        I decided on a caterpillar since it’s not a common insect people think of, and they have many different physical characteristics. 
        We then were to trace over our drawings using tracing paper and micro pens. However, the traced image should lack miniscule details. 
        I had some trouble with this initially because it looked too busy, but I let go of some details and it started to come together. 
        This gives it more of a “clip-art’ look. We then scanned our drawn images, making them PNG images, and worked with them in Adobe Illustrator. 
        The poster had to have some sort of typography that related to your insect and matched the overall theme, including the typeface.
        Because I chose a caterpillar, I automatically thought of butterflies. One of the most common butterfly sayings are “you give me butterflies”, or “I have butterflies”, so I knew I wanted to go with that. 
        My thought process from there was “love”. I flipped my image and added a leaf heart to make it more obvious. The picture is off-center to make it more interesting. 
        I felt the typeface I chose mimicked the segments of the caterpillar’s body. I also added the rounded effect.</p>
