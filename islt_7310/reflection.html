 <h2>My Past Experiences and Future Endeavors</h2>
<p><b>W</b>hen I initially enrolled at the University of Missouri, I didn’t have a solidified idea of what I wanted to do as a career.
    Because I like math, I came into the Fall 2018 semester as an Industrial Engineer major.
    As I realized this wasn’t a good fit for me, the following semester I became undecided. I have a love for animals, so I decided to become an Animal Science major. 
    Although I enjoyed this, it wasn’t something I could see myself doing in my everyday life. I then transferred over to the business school, where I had a focus in marketing. 
    I have excellent strategic and planning skills and felt this would be a good way to put my creativity to use as well. 
    Although, this was a good fit for me, I knew I still wasn’t exactly where I belonged.
    Finally, I decided to transfer to Arts and Science where I would focus in Graphic Design.
    <br>
    <br>Graphic design is a great way for me to use my interrelation, artistic, and marketing skills, all in one career. 
    I knew once I enjoyed the work I was given, I was in the right place. As I continue to expand my knowledge and gain experience with graphic design, my passion for it continues to grow as well. 
    However, because I had taken so long to decide on a major, my presumed graduation date would have been December 2023, as opposed to May 2022.
    So, I decided to make a solidified career plan, that I felt was more feasible for me. Rather than taking the full graphic design course, I have decided to pursue a Bachelor’s in Arts and Science in Interdisciplinary Studies. 
    I have component focuses on graphic design, business, and cultural studies. With this degree, I am eligible to graduate in December 2022, while continuing to study within the fields that I enjoy. 
   <br>
    <br>Moving forward, once I have graduated, I will attend hair school at Paul Mitchell in Chicago. 
    Becoming a hairstylist is also a major passion of mine, and I feel it is important to be well-rounded and always have a “Plan B”. 
    With this certification, I plan to continue to branch-off my hair business, “Shop Nina Imani”, as well as open a salon. 
    Further in the future, I would be willing to work with celebrities, fashion show events, photo shoots, and many other opportunities that are available within the cosmetology field. 
    Until then, I will continue to do hair, as well as individually build my graphic design portfolio, which I will use to apply for graduate school once I have finished my course at Paul Mitchell. 
    <br>
    <br>Building the website for this web design and development class is a perfect opportunity for me to showcase my marketing, graphic design, and web design experience. 
    I plan on using the website to apply to schools, and to expand my graphic design business “Imani Design”. Hopefully receiving my master’s in graphic design will open many doors for me. 
    I would love to work for a magazine company, or a company that is looking for someone with great interpersonal, artistic, and marketing skills.
    <br>
    <br>Although I was very indecisive in the beginning of my educational career, I finally feel comfortable and happy with where I am now. 
    I strive to work hard and master my skills and create new opportunities for myself; and I will continue to be positive and open minded. 
    As both a graphic design and hair artist, I aim to show the world new concepts, creativity, and me as an individual. 
    I’m very excited to see what’s in store for me!</p>
